        We've all been there - the check arrives after a <strong>group dinner</strong>, and suddenly there's an awkward silence. Who pays? How do you <strong>split the bill</strong>? What if someone had three cocktails while you stuck to water?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Bill splitting</strong> doesn't have to be a source of tension. Here are five essential tips to make the process fair and stress-free when <strong>sharing expenses with friends</strong>:
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="discuss-payment-expectations">1. Discuss Payment Expectations Before Ordering</h2>
      
      <p>
        The best way to avoid awkwardness is to address <strong>how you'll split the bill</strong> upfront. Before you even order, briefly mention how you plan to handle the bill. A simple "Should we split evenly or pay for our own items?" sets clear expectations for everyone involved.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This approach is especially important for groups with different spending habits or financial situations. Setting the ground rules early eliminates confusion later when it's time to pay.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="use-bill-splitting-app">2. Use the FLICK2SPLIT App for Accurate Bill Splitting</h2>
      
      <p>
        Instead of mental math or awkward calculator passing, use a dedicated <strong>bill splitting app</strong> like FLICK2SPLIT to quickly scan the receipt and assign items to each person. This ensures everyone pays exactly for what they ordered, plus their fair share of tax and tip.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        With FLICK2SPLIT, you can simply take a photo of the receipt, and the app uses advanced technology to identify each item. Then you can easily assign dishes to different friends, making <strong>expense sharing</strong> quick and accurate.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="consider-income-disparities">3. Consider Income Disparities Among Friends</h2>
      
      <p>
        If your friend group has varying income levels, be sensitive to this reality when <strong>splitting expenses</strong>. Sometimes the fairest approach isn't strictly mathematical. In close friend groups, those who can afford more might occasionally treat others or suggest less expensive venues.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The goal of <strong>fair bill splitting</strong> isn't to create financial stress, but to maintain healthy friendships while respecting everyone's financial boundaries.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="non-monetary-contributions">4. Account for Non-Monetary Contributions</h2>
      
      <p>
        Did someone drive everyone to the restaurant? Did a friend spend hours planning the outing? Consider these non-monetary contributions when <strong>splitting costs with friends</strong>. The person who drove might pay a bit less to account for gas and wear on their vehicle.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A truly <strong>fair expense sharing</strong> system acknowledges that contributions to group activities come in many forms, not just who paid the bill.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="settle-up-promptly">5. Settle Up Promptly When Splitting Bills</h2>
      
      <p>
        The longer a debt lingers, the more awkward it becomes. Make it a habit to <strong>settle bills immediately</strong> using digital payment methods. FLICK2SPLIT integrates with popular payment apps to make this seamless.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Prompt settlement prevents any lingering tension about <strong>who owes what</strong> and allows everyone to move on from the financial aspect of your shared experience.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="when-to-split-evenly">When to Split Bills Evenly vs. Itemizing Expenses</h3>
      
      <p>
        As a general rule of thumb when deciding how to <strong>split a group bill</strong>:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Split evenly when:</strong> Everyone ordered roughly the same amount, you all shared multiple dishes, or the difference in spending is minimal.</li>
        <li><strong>Itemize expenses when:</strong> There are significant disparities in what people ordered, someone doesn't drink alcohol while others had multiple drinks, or dietary restrictions resulted in price differences.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Remember, the goal isn't perfect mathematical fairness in every situation, but rather maintaining positive relationships while ensuring no one feels taken advantage of. Sometimes, the simplest approach is to alternate who pays the entire bill across multiple outings.
      </p>
